# Intro

It's important to keep project organisation simple.
Moreover it's important to keep file organisation simple too.
For this reason I decide to write it.

# General rules

Each folder has it's own role. 
The folder name must be explicit.
Use CamelCase for folder name.

```
/home/user
├── Perso 
└── Dev
```

## Perso folder

This folder is for personnal files such as Password files, vpn files, personnal notes..

```
Perso
├── KPass
├── Articles
└── RecoveryKey
```

## Dev folder

This folder is for coding projects
Each languages has his own folder.

```
Dev
├── C
├── C++
├── Php
├── SQL
└── Web
```

### Coding folder style

Each coding language folder has a Cours folder for what I do during my lessons, and a Learning folder for what project made to learn / understand a standards / techno.

```
Language
├── Cours
└── Learning
```
