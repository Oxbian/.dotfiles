# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles. 

There is my vscode settings with some custom snippets, my neofetch customisation.
Also a coding style and folder style.

## Installation

To install my dotfiles, just clone the repository, and run the install file:

`git clone https://github.com/Oxbian/.dotfiles.git && cd .dotfiles && ./install`


## Package to install

If something isn't working it's probably because a package is missing.

These packages must be installed on your machine for dotfiles to work:
